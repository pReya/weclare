## What is Weclare?

Weclare is an acronym for "**we**b based **cla**ssroom **re**sponse system".  

It is the prototype(!) of a classroom response system specifically designed for the use in computer science education at the university level. 

Weclare was designed to fulfill these high-level requirements:

- Web based (no downloads necessary for both involved parties)
- Interactive code execution of Java code snippets in the browser (running a JVM in the browser)
- Peer-to-Peer design: No or minimal (only for signalling) server interaction required (based on WebRTC)
- Good formatting options for code snippets (Syntax Highlighting)

## What is a classroom response system?

A CRS is a special case of an "Audience Response System" directed towards class room use in universities or schools. It allows an instructor to direct questions at the audience (students), which they can then interactively answer. CRS can exist as dedicated hardware systems (think of little remote boxes with buttons on them). But nowadays CRS are mostly software systems that can be used with many devices like computers, tablets or smartphones.

## What is the motivation behind the creation of Weclare?

Weclare is the result of a bachelor thesis by Moritz St√ºckler at HAW Hamburg. It is heavily inspired by an existing system called ["StuReSy" made by another student at the University of Hamburg](https://github.com/sturesy).  

However today, StuReSy seems unnecessarily complicated. It needs a dedicated server component and a Java Client to be configured when creating questions. Also it lacks a lot of computer science specific features (formatting source code fragments, syntax highlighting, etc).
